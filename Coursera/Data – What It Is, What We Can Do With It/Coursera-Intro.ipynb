    "*(It's not about the data)*\n",
    "Goal:turn piles of numbers into actionable insights\n",
    "'Big Data' is nearly useless without some type of analytic capacity. The challenge of our age is figuring out how to combine, match, disambiguate, remove duplicates, and extract insights from large and diverse data sets that often do not fit into a traditional rectangular data set model.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "* structured\n",
    "    - variables defined by the person who created the dataset\n",
    "* unstructured\n",
    "    - no predefined structure, the analyst quantifies the data and develops the structure\n",
    "    - There are unavoidable value judgments in assigning analyzable values on unstructured data points, thus these underlying assumptions need to be public and questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyses\n",
    "* Quantitative (numerical)\n",
    "    - quantitative data is more precise, easier to replicate, predictive\n",
    "* Qualtitative (non-numerical)\n",
    "    - but not everything is quantifiable. Qualitative data allows for a deeper description of phenomena and the exploration of subtle differences in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of analysis is to answer an overarching research question. Most research will involve a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data. The art of data science is in recognizing the imnportance of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain Knowledge\n",
    "You need to know a lot about a topic to develop effective measures.\n",
    "Only then can you discern what are the important factors that need to be measured in order to create an effective analysis.\n",

    "* Descriptive\n",
    "    - conjecture about the characteristics of a phenomena\n",
    "* Causal\n",
    "    - conjecture about the causes of a phenomena\n",
    "    requires dependent and independent variables. The independent variables causes the phenomena, the dependent variable is the result \n",
    "    - causal theories suggest that an observable outcome has a specific cause\n",
    "\n",
    "### characteristics of a good theory\n",
    "* positive (not normative)\n",
    "    - a positive theory describes how the world is, whereas a normative theory describes how the world ought to be. The difficulty with normative theories from a scientific perspective is that they are impossible to prove correct or incorrect. In contrast a positive theory can be proven or disproven with empirical evidence\n",
    "        example:\n",
    "        normative: enhanced interrogation techniques are unjust and should be abolished\n",
    "        postive: enhanced interrogation techniques produce false information\n",
    "* observable implications\n",
    "    - good theories predict that something observable will occur\n",
    "    - to prove or disprove the theory it is enough to show that the predicted observable result did or did not occur\n",
    "* testable\n",
    "    - if a theory is unfalsifiable -- that is if everything we observe in the world is compatible with the theory -- it cannot be empirically tested\n",
    "    - to be testable:\n",
    "        1) necessary data must be available\n",
    "        2) adequate time to test the theory is needed\n",
    "        3) testing procedure must be ethical\n",
    "* generalizable\n",
    "    - applies to more than one case, that is it should apply to more than one instance of a phenomenon\n",
    "* parsimonious\n",
    "    - do not contain unneccesary parts that complicate the issue\n",
    "    - simpler is generally better\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theories in Scientific Research\n",
    "> a scientific theory is a system of constructs (concepts) and propositions (relationships between those constructs) that collectively presents a logical, systematic, and coherent explanation of a phenomenon of interest within some assumptions and boundary conditions (Bacharach 1989)\n",
    "\n",
    "Theories should explain why things happen, rather than being simply predictive. Prediction only needs correlation, wheras a theory should encompass causation. To establish causation, three things are needed:\n",
    "1) correlation between two constructs\n",
    "2) temporal precedence (the cause must preced the effect)\n",
    "3) alternative explanations as to cause must be able to be disproven through testing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion prompt\n",
    "Have you come across any examples of policy decisions that were based on questionable evidence?  Did this evidence, such as a research study, violate any of the fundamental principles discussed in this course?  Or did the policymaker perhaps draw an improper conclusion from the study, such as placing too much confidence in the results?  Please share your thoughts and examples here.  \n",
    "### Response\n",
    "You need look no further than the response to COVID-19 to find ample examples of questionable findings driving policy decisions. It is striking to see epidemiologists such as Anthony Fauci carefully elaborating on what is provably known and unknown in terms of the science of this pandemic based upon his lifetime of study, and to have Fauci's perspective distorted, disputed, and overridden by politicos such as Anthony Caputo (advised by Paul Alexander promoting 'herd immunity' ) for the purpose of political gain. When we abandon truth in favor of a false narrative, we are courting disaster. With the unprecedented (and unnecessary) spike in COVID infections and deaths we are currently experiencing, we see firsthand the consequences of doing so. "

    "## Causal Effect and Potential Outcomes Framework\n",
    "Causal questions have two outcomes, factual and counterfactual. Factual outcomes are what happens in the presence of a given manipulation, whereas counterfactual outcomes are what happens in the absence fo that manipulation\n",
    "The true causal effect is the difference between the factual outcome and the counterfactual outcome. But both cannot be observed for the same population with the same inputs at the same time. Hence the counterfactual is by nature unobserved (and speculative?)\n",
    "For a group of observations, you can divide inviduals into two groups.  a group of individuals subjected to an intervention and group of individuals not subjected to the intervention (the control group).\n",
    "The control group can be used to estimate the counterfactual for the treatment units.\n",
    "Because we can only observe one outcome for each person, and because there are many variables outside of the measurement scopt that can effect the outcomes, estimatin of causal effects is challenging\n",
